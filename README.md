# Asteroid Miner

WIP of an Asteroid Miner clone. Example footage of the original game can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1fseBg0E-g).

## Please Note!
This repo does not contain any of the actual asset files used in the project in order to keep its size small; only the files required by Unity to open and edit the project, and the C# code written to implement various aspects of the game. As such, it is not possible to build the project from this repo.

## Features Currently Implemented
The clone currently has the following features:
- Spaceship movement, including drifting when the thrusters are no longer active
- Firing bullets (including pew pew sound effect :grin:)
- Spaceship collisions with meteors - bounces off, with sound effects
- Bullets hitting asteroids, with explosions and sound effects
- Material gathering - currently bronze, silver and gold materials
- Inventory screen to show the current quantities of each material held by the player

## Coming Soon
The following features will be implemented soon:
- Score, fuel and damage stats
- Planets and currency
- Selling materials and upgrading the ship
- Enemies
- And more...

In addition, screenshots will soon be available on this project's [webpage](https://kaitlenw.github.io/asteroid-miner.html) and here.
